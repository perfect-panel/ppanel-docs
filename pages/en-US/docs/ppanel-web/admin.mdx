## Deploy with Docker

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perfect-panel/ppanel-admin-web.git
   cd ppanel-admin-web
   ```

2. **Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file:**

   Customize the environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file as needed:

   ```yml
   version: '3'

   services:
     web:
       container_name: ppanel-user
       build:
         context: ./
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       args:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITTER_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_LINK:
         NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_LINK:
       restart: always
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
   ```

3. **Build and run Docker containers:**

   Use the following command to build and run the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will build the Docker image and start the application in detached mode.

4. **Access the application:**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Stopping the Containers

To stop the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but preserve built images and volumes.

### Customization

You can adjust the `docker-compose.yml` file to customize ports, volumes, or add other services.
